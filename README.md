# Pi Browser Extension

Scripts to recreate Pi Browser app within a browser on your computer.

## How to use

First, install the [Tampermonkey extension](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (choose the browser you're using and follow the steps). When it's done, install both **pi-browser-extension-core** and **pi-browser-extension-iframe** scripts [here](https://pinetwork-js.github.io/pi-browser-extension/core/pi-browser-extension-core.user.js) and [here](https://pinetwork-js.github.io/pi-browser-extension/iframe/pi-browser-extension-iframe.user.js) (it will open the Tampermonkey dashboard with the script you want to install, just click on the install button to save it in your browser).

**Note:** Make sure you have both **pi-browser-extension-core** and **pi-browser-extension-iframe** scripts installed!

Now you can go to the [Pi App website](https://app-cdn.minepi.com) and wait a little until the Pi Node login page appears, then connect into your account as if you were using the Pi Node app on your computer.

**Note:** You cannot manipulate/monitor your node in the browser, this must be done in the Pi Node app!

When you're logged in, you can go to the [Pi Browser homepage](https://app-cdn.minepi.com/browser?url=pinet.com). If you want to go to your app within Pi Browser, go to https://app-cdn.minepi.com/browser?url=URL_OF_YOUR_APP

**Note:** You can bookmark the Pi Browser homepage to find it more easily later!

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY PROBLEM ON YOUR ACCOUNT FOLLOWING THE USE OF MY SCRIPTS, THEY ONLY TRY TO REPRODUCE THE FUNCTIONING OF PI BROWSER (YOU CAN EASILY SEE IT BY LOOKING AT THE CODE, NO MALICIOUS MANIPULATION OUTSIDE THE APP IS DONE). IF YOU FIND ANOTHER SCRIPT PRETENDING TO DO THE "SAME" THING OR A MODIFIED VERSION OF MY WORK, BE CAREFUL, YOU CAN EASILY GET YOUR WHOLE PI ACCOUNT STOLEN (THIS IS NOT A JOKE)!
